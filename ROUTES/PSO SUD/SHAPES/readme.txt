Notes:
1. This is beta! I will be adding additional objects as well as modifying the objects included here. Files contained in later versions of this package will replace items in this archive.

2. These are high poly count items. Sigh... the curse of the finescale modeler's mentality.

3. The enclosed jpeg file shows how these buildings are laid out on the D&RGW Royal Gorge Route for which they were created. For your own routes, arrange them as you like.

4. There are several silos through which you can lay track. The prototype plant loads materials into trucks using these, but I have tried to make them large enough that railroad cars can be used. If they don't fit, sorry.

5. The processor building (processor.s) object was created and textured by Mike Rector using 3D Canvas. I have made minor modifications to the textures to match the prototype colors more closely. Mike set the axis of origin for this building to center. Once you have placed it you'll need to raise it to ground level.

6. I have included 100 and 200 foot conveyor modules you can use to connect things with. Use your imagination.

7. The north hopper complex doesn't appear in the jpeg; it's actually across the river from the main plant and is connected with a 1500 foot conveyor.

Installation:

Copy the s and sd files into your route's shapes folder; copy the ace files into your route's textures folder. Add the contents of the included ref file to your ref file.

Connents and suggestions are appreciated.

Have fun.
